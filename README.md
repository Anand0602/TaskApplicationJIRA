# TaskApplicationJIRA

This project is a Task Management application (presumably inspired by JIRA) built using a .NET backend, an Angular frontend, and MS SQL Server as the database.  **(Note: At the time of writing this README based on the repository's current state, the application code itself seems to be missing. This README assumes the intended structure and functionality based on standard practices and the provided `UserService` code.)**


## Project Description

This application aims to provide users with a platform to manage their tasks effectively.  While the full feature set is not yet implemented in the available code, a typical task management application would include functionalities such as:

* **Creating Tasks:** Defining new tasks with descriptions, due dates, priorities, and assigned users.
* **Viewing Tasks:** Listing tasks, filtering them by various criteria (e.g., status, assignee, due date), and searching for specific tasks.
* **Updating Tasks:** Modifying existing tasks, changing their status, updating details, and reassigning users.
* **Deleting Tasks:** Removing completed or unnecessary tasks.
* **User Management:**  (Partially implemented in the provided `UserService`) Managing user accounts, including creating, updating, and deleting users.  Likely also includes authentication and authorization features.
* **(Potentially) Project Management:** Grouping tasks into projects for better organization.


## Technologies Used

* **Backend:** .NET MVC (Specific .NET framework version to be confirmed).
* **Frontend:** Angular (Specific Angular version to be confirmed).
* **Database:** MS SQL Server.
* **Other (Potential/Planned):** Docker .

## Getting Started (Placeholder - Code Missing)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  
1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone https://github.com/Anand0602/TaskApplicationJIRA.git`
2. **Database Setup:** Create a MS SQL Server database and configure the connection string in the application's configuration files.
3. **Backend Setup:**  Restore NuGet packages, build the .NET project, and run the backend server.
4. **Frontend Setup:** Install npm packages, build the Angular project, and start the development server.
